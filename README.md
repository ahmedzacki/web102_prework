## Notes

Completing this project was mostly straightforward, but the only challenge would be organizing the code and ensuring readability. The task involved making sure that the code was well-structured, easy to read, and followed best practices. To tackle this, I spent time reviewing the code's structure, comments, and variable names, making improvements to enhance overall clarity. I considered refactoring and added comments where needed. Despite this particular challenge, I genuinely enjoyed every moment of working on the project. It was a rewarding experience overall, and I took pleasure in the process.
